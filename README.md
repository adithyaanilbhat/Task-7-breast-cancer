# SVM Binary Classification â€“ Task 7

This project implements binary classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with both linear and RBF kernels on the Breast Cancer dataset as a part of the Elevate AI ML Internship Labs Task 7. Visualizations, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluations are included[attached file: task-7.pdf].

## Features

- SVM with linear and RBF kernels  
- Visual decision boundaries  
- Hyperparameter optimization (C, gamma)  
- Cross-validation and test set evaluation  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- scikit-learn  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  

Install dependencies:

## Usage

Clone the repo and run the script:

This script will train the models, show decision boundary plots, and print the evaluation metrics.

## Outputs

- Decision boundary images for both kernels  
- Hyperparameter optimization results (best C, gamma)  
- Cross-validation scores and test set classification report
